This is a helpful document to assist anyone who wonders how you need to run the VBA scripts.

Editing VBA scripts

In order to edit the VBA you need to have SolidWorks open.
Go to Tools > Macro > Edit 
And Open the .swp file.

A nice intro to vba can be found here.

The Documentation for VBA is largely on Microsofts Website here.
Note VBA (Visual Basic for applications) is not the same thing as Visual Basic. Its close but not identical.

Running VBA scripts (.swp files)

There are multiple ways to run the macro.

For large scale automation the external project chooses to use
#TASK which automates the execution. This is likely what will be done
in the consolidated project as well.

You need to download this from CentralInovation's website (free of charge).

The macro may also be run from within SolidWorks itself, just use

Tools > Macro > Run

This saves much of the time spent in #TASK loading the VBA engine.
