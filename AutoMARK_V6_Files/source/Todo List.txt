

End of Summer 2019:


	Mostly done!
	Everything is nice and usable, even if just barely so for some things.
	It still provides a lot of usable feedback to students and is very extensible.

	Still left to do:
		Documentation















This is a huge list of things that need to be done!

AUTOMARK:
	Comparable Drawings:
		* Complete all the different types of comparable objects
		* Not currently frozen, properties are subject to change
	
	Drawing Linker:
		* Need to plan a way to compare and link features in a key drawing to a 
		given drawing, (This view on this sheet corresponds to that view on that sheet)
		* Likely going to be done in a fairly naive ish way?
		
	Marking Template:
		* Need to apply subtractive rubric model to a bunch of virtual criterion
		* Annotation Model inside the virtual criterion

		Virtual Criterion:
			* Need to create the inheritance heirarchy of tolerance types
			* Need to create each of the individual classes for those
			* Need to create each virtual criterion type, AKA Dimension Location criterion and whatnot.
	
	Marked Template:
		* Need some kind of Output Excel file? Might not work on this till later since its really specific.
		* Definitley will work on an internally representable "marked drawing" format though. Likely will be 
		 fairly simplistic though.
		 
		 
		
	Marker:
		Glue together the Automark part of Automark, basically make it so you can call some functions and have
		some marking take place.

GUI:
	Not Started as of yet! But is an important component
	
	Needs to handle the following things:
		* Glue together the rest of the program pretty much (make sure components work)
		* Some kind of visuals provided as well for doing things (pop up boxes for files?)
		* 

	
REPORTTOOLS:
	Word docs, Not started, likely won't actually be done!

Visual Basic Script:
	* Currently looking really nasty, likely needs to be fully refactored to work.
	* #TASK won't see the arguments, only loads 300 lines?

	* Doesn't seem to follow the API correctly? It doesn't use the Interface types and just kind of
	makes lots of problems. This refers to using the i-interfaces instead of direct objects.
	* This is probably a non-issue?

	* Should be fixable with a more or less 1-1 remapping!
	* This makes going from Excel -> Comparable Drawing a very complicated endevour

Misc:
	* Does MATLAB support proper garbage collection
		YES!
	
	* Is lots of array concatination acceptable for speed (its the classic MATLAB bad practice thing to do)!
		Its okay as it turns out, its bad, like really bad, but computers are still more than fast enough.





Touch Ups (Improvement suggestions for iterative design)

1. Actually Mark the TitleBlock
2. Read in extraneous information (iterate through all annotations and grab simple information)
