This folder contains the code for the internal handling of data in MATLAB and all of the
functions which interface outwards. This is where all of the actual marking takes place.

In some sense this is the entirety of the actual project. The rest of it is just gizmos attached
onto AUTOMARK to make it easier to use. Granted those gizmos are quite important.
